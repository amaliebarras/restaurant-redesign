    <h5>PARKING </h5><p>
    We know parking can be difficult at times - unfortunately, there's not too much we can do about this. However, there is extra parallel street parking on South Congress just a block south of us. And during the evenings and weekends, there is parking across Riverside in the TxDOT parking lots.</p>

    <h5>HOURS</h5>
    <p>Monday - Friday | 6:30AM – 11PM<br>
    Saturday - Sunday  |  7AM – 11PM</p>

    <p>
      <b>The kids at both Makarios and Doulos Discovery School </b>

      Proceeds from the sale of the coffee go right into their education.<br><br>

      <b>The farmers and their families</b><br>
      We buy according to fair trade practices and pay fair prices in order to help them improve their lives.<br><br>

      <b>Our customers</b><br>
      You’re not just getting a good cup o’ Joe. You’re also helping someone in poverty take a step out of that world and into something better.

<h3>story</h3>
  <div class="lighttext textcolumn1 column column-6">
    <p>The Dominican Joe concept was born in early 2005, as a partnership between Mehul Patel (local entrepreneur) and Sharla Megilligan (founder of Makarios).<br><br>

    Our goal was simply to make a difference in the world. The question we faced: could we provide Austin with a high quality coffee shop in way that made an impact in the world? </p>
  </div>
   <div class="lighttext textcolumn2 column column-6">
     <p>The vision took shape in early 2006, and on September 19th, after about 18 crazy months, we opened our doors in the heart of Austin at the corner of South Congress and Riverside Drive. Yay us! <br><br>

      We breathed a sigh of relief and celebrated and then realized that was the easy part... </p>
